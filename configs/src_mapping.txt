In this file write each line to folder/file related to `src` dir
For example:
administrator/components/com_component_one
administrator/components/com_component_two
administrator/manifests/packages/pkg_component_one.xml
plugins/user/custom_plugin.php

Then when you run `bin/create_symlinks.sh` it will read each line
of this file and will create symlink to `wwwNameOfJoomlaInstallation`

From there you edit files inside `src` and as it's symlinked to
all `www*` joomla installation, it will automatically change it
there too.
